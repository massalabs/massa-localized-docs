#~ "The goal here is to allow "
#~ "addresses on Massa to store not "
#~ "only a balance, bytecode and a "
#~ "datastore, but also files, zip archive"
#~ " and websites without using any "
#~ "centralised party in between your client"
#~ " and the blockchain. Any address, "
#~ "through bytecode execution, can initialize,"
#~ " read and write the \"file\" part "
#~ "into the datastore. Files or websites,"
#~ " for instance, are complex objects "
#~ "built on top of native objects "
#~ "(eg: balance, bytecode...) to enable "
#~ "users to do more while assuring "
#~ "full decentralisation. The reason why we"
#~ " don’t simply reuse the datastore for"
#~ " this, outside of the risk of "
#~ "key collisions, is for easier auditing:"
#~ " if the code never writes into "
#~ "its own bytecode nor its datastore "
#~ "after deployment, it is safe to "
#~ "assume that the stored website can’t "
#~ "change anymore. Which means that Massa"
#~ " can host the files corresponding to"
#~ " the front-end of the decentralized"
#~ " applications. Since the front-end is"
#~ " hosted on the blockchain, allowing "
#~ "anyone to access it using a Massa"
#~ " node. For that Massa has developed"
#~ " a client that acts as a "
#~ "gateway to the blockchain preventing you"
#~ " from using any centralised servers "
#~ "but also maximising your security with"
#~ " immutable and censorship resistant "
