#~ "operation pool and in the future "
#~ "included in a block to be "

#~ "execution time. With autonomous SCs, the"
#~ " message is emitted inside of the "
#~ "operation and and you pay the gas"
#~ " for the message execution upfront. "
#~ "The message is then sent to "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The pool has a finite size, and"

#~ "there is a priority, which is "
#~ "computed from the message emission fees,"
#~ " maximum execution gas, and length of"

#~ "executed at the slot that you want"
#~ " (such as operations that could be"
#~ " not included in the first block "
#~ "after you sent it), but in a "
#~ "later slot, when there is enough "
#~ "space to include your message. If "
