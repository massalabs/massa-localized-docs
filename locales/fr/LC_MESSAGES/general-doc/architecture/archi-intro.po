"The goal of the Massa network is to build a consensus between **nodes** "
"to gather and order **blocks** that contains ordered lists of "
"**operations**. An operation ultimate purpose once executed is to act as "
"transitions for the global network state, called the **ledger**."

"Operations are produced by external clients and sent to the Massa network"
" via a node. Some operations are containing code to be run as **smart "
"contracts**, enabling complex programmatic modifications of the ledger. "
"Nodes will gather all the pending operations and group them to produce "
"blocks. Each block contains a finite set of operations, limited by the "
"fact that each block has a limited amount of space available to store "
"operations. Traditional blockchains will then typically link blocks one "
"after the other (including a hash of the previous block in the block "
"header), to materialize their temporal ordering. However, unlike "
"traditional blockchains, Massa blocks are not simply chained one after "
"the other, but organized into a more complex spatio-temporal structure, "
"which allows for parallelization and increased performances."

"The time between two slots located on the same thread is called a "
"**period** and lasts 16s (conventionally called :math:`t_0`). "
"Corresponding slots in threads are slightly shifted in time relative to "
"one another, by one period divided by the number of threads, which is "
"16s/32 = 0.5s, so that a period contains exactly 32 slots equally spaced "
"over the 32 threads. A **cycle** is defined as the succession of 128 "
"periods and so lasts a bit more than 34min. Periods are numbered by "
"increments of one, so can be used together with a thread number to "
"uniquely identify a block slot. Period 0 is the genesis and contains "
"genesis blocks with no parents."
