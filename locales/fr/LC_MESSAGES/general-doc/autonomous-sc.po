"Automating IT processes are at the heart of pretty much every industry we"
" can think of, and if we narrow it down to modern finance, nowadays most "
"actions are initiated by automated mechanisms. When we take a closer look"
" at decentralized finance, only certain actions of lending and "
"arbitration are done automatically, however they are executed by bots "
"operating off-chain. This is because without external calls, smart "
"contracts as they exist in all public blockchains cannot perform "
"automated operations."

"Many decentralized protocols rely on recurrent triggers of certain "
"functions in order to work as planned. In case of decentralized lending "
"protocols, borrowers lock crypto assets (cryptocurrencies or fungible "
"tokens) in order to take out loans. When the price of the collateralized "
"asset decreases below a threshold, the borrower’s position becomes under-"
"collateralized if he doesn’t promptly react to the decrease in value of "
"that collateral. To ensure that the protocol behaves correctly, such "
"positions must be liquidated. Liquidations are currently performed by "
"organizations or individuals running bots, usually on some centralized "
"cloud services."

"There are countless applications that rely on such recurrent triggers. As"
" a result, a lot of time and energy has been spent trying to develop more"
" reliable networks of bots to guarantee that transactions are executed "
"when needed. However, as those solutions are inherently off-chain, "
"there’s no guarantee that the execution will be effectively triggered. "
"And when those bots `fail to execute such transactions "
"<https://insights.glassnode.com/what-really-happened-to-makerdao/>`_, "
"those protocols are at risk (and the applications built on top of them)."

"Massa’s Autonomous Smart Contracts solve the issues of lacking "
"reliability, sophistication and centralization around dApps that want to "
"offer automated smart contract executions on behalf of their users. "
"Autonomous Smart Contracts introduce self wake-up capabilities to smart "
"contracts. In the future, smart contracts could be programmed to perform "
"arbitrary operations, for example triggering a call when a specific "
"exchange rate target of an LP pool is met."

"Such automated capabilities open the door to various applications, from "
"automated liquidation of under-collateralized positions on lending "
"protocols, to on-chain trading bots, or ever evolving NFTs."
