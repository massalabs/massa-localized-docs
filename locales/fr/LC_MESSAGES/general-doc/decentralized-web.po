"It states among other things that once successfully audited, a program "
"can remain trusted. This implies that the program of a successfully "
"audited smart contract may never be unexpectedly changed by an outsider "
"(note that contracts that modify their own code during runtime cannot be "
"trusted this way in the first place, but this is visible in the code "
"audit). Popular ETH smart contracts essentially follow that rule."

"However, most DeFi web3 apps such as `app.uniswap.org "
"<https://app.uniswap.org/>`_ are typically used through an otherwise "
"normal website that talks to a browser plugin (typically `Metamask "
"<https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension>`_) allowing the webpage "
"to interact with the user's wallet and the blockchain. The website that "
"serves as an entry point to the dApp is neither decentralized nor "
"immutable-once-audited. This breaks the very foundation of blockchain "
"security. And that’s how you get into situations of scandalous thefts in "
"the DeFi world, like `this one "
"<https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-"
"hack-bitcoin-ethereum>`_."

"The goal here is to allow addresses on Massa to store not only a balance,"
" bytecode and a datastore, but also files, zip archive and websites "
"without using any centralised party in between your client and the "
"blockchain. Any address, through bytecode execution, can initialize, read"
" and write the \"file\" part into the datastore. Files or websites, for "
"instance, are complex objects built on top of native objects (eg: "
"balance, bytecode...) to enable users to do more while assuring full "
"decentralisation. The reason why we don’t simply reuse the datastore for "
"this, outside of the risk of key collisions, is for easier auditing: if "
"the code never writes into its own bytecode nor its datastore after "
"deployment, it is safe to assume that the stored website can’t change "
"anymore. Which means that Massa can host the files corresponding to the "
"front-end of the decentralized applications. Since the front-end is "
"hosted on the blockchain, allowing anyone to access it using a Massa "
"node. For that Massa has developed a client that acts as a gateway to the"
" blockchain preventing you from using any centralised servers but also "
"maximising your security with immutable and censorship resistant "
"websites."
