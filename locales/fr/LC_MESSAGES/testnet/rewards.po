"To help achieve our goal of a fully decentralized and scaled blockchain, "
"we designed a staking rewards program during the testnet phase."

"Staking is what improves the security of the network. By buying rolls "
"(freezing your coins) and producing your share of the blocks, you help "
"honest nodes collectively protect against potential attackers, who must "
"not reach 51% of the block production. On mainnet, staking is "
"incentivized through block rewards: for each block produced, you get some"
" Massa. On testnet however, you get testnet Massa which has no value, "
"this is why we will reward you with mainnet Massa for learning to set up "
"your node and stake right now, which also helps us improve the staking "
"user experience."

"On July 16th we launched the first public version of Massa, the first "
"testnet. More than 350 nodes were connected at the same time after one "
"week, which overloaded our bootstrap nodes which were the only nodes "
"accepting connections. By setting your node up to be routable (with a "
"public IP), you become a real peer in the peer-to-peer network: you not "
"only connect to existing routable nodes, but you offer other people the "
"possibility to access the network through your connection. We will "
"therefore also reward how often your node is publicly accessible."
