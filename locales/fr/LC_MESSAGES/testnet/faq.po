"The philosophy of Massa is to be as decentralized as possible. To fulfill"
" this goal, we aim to have low hardware requirements so that many people "
"can run nodes. Right now 4 cores and 8 GB of RAM should be enough to run "
"a node. As the transaction rate increases, it might not be sufficient "
"anymore. Ultimately, we plan that the mainnet fits on a desktop computer "
"with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 1TB disk."
