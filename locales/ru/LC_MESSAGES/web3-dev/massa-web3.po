"`massa-web3 <https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3>`_ is a TypeScript "
"library that allow you to interact with the Massa blockchain through a "
"local or remote Massa node. In particular the massa-web3 library will "
"allow you to call the :ref:`JSON-RPC API <technical-api>`, but also to "
"fetch and poll events from smart contracts on the Massa blockchain, "
"deploy smart contracts and much more. Documentation for the massa-web3 "
"library is available on the `Github repository "
"<https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3>`_. The library is published on "
"npmjs under `@massalabs/massa-web3 "
