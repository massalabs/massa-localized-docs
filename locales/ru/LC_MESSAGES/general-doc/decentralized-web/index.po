"The \"*code is law*\" rule is a cornerstone of DeFi. It states among "
"other things that once successfully audited, a program can remain "
"trusted. This implies that the program of a successfully audited smart "
"contract may never be unexpectedly changed by an outsider (note that "
"contracts that modify their own code during runtime cannot be trusted "
"this way in the first place, but this is visible in the code audit). "
"Popular ETH smart contracts essentially follow that rule."

"However, most DeFi web3 apps such as `app.uniswap.org "
"<https://app.uniswap.org/>`_ are typically used through an otherwise "
"normal website that talks to a browser plugin (typically `Metamask "
"<https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension>`_) allowing the webpage "
"to interact with the user's wallet and the blockchain. The website that "
"serves as an entry point to the dApp is neither decentralized nor "
"immutable-once-audited. This breaks the very foundation of blockchain "
"security."

"This attack vector has been well identified by exploiters and, as smart "
"contracts become more robust, exploiters are increasingly targeting front"
" ends. For instance, in 2022, one of the major DeFi protocols, `Curve "
"Finance <https://curve.fi/>`_, fell victim to `DNS hijacking "
"<https://rekt.news/curve-finance-rekt/>`_, with hackers managing to steal"
" as much as $575k from users. As long as decentralized applications rely "

"The goal of Massa's decentralized web is to allow users to store websites"
" without using any centralized party in between your client and the "
"blockchain. Since the front-end is hosted on the blockchain, anyone can "
"access it using a Massa node. For that Massa has developed a client that "
"acts as a gateway to the blockchain preventing you from using any "
"centralized servers effectively maximizing your security with immutable "
"and censorship-resistant websites."
