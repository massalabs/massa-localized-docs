"communicate, propagate blocks and operations, and maintain consensus and "
"synchrony all together."

"For node A to establish a connection towards node B, node B must be "
"routable. This means that node B has a public IP address that can be "
"reached from node A and that ports TCP 31244 and TCP 31245 are open on "
"node B and that inbound connection on those ports are allowed by "
"firewalls on node B. Once such a connection is established, communication"
" through this connection is bidirectional, and it does not matter anymore"
" which one of the two nodes initiated the connection establishment."

"If only a small number of nodes are routable, all other nodes will be "
"able to connect only to those routable nodes, which can overload them and"
" generally hurt the decentralization and security of the network, as "
"those few routable nodes become de-facto central communication hubs, "
"choke points, and single points of failure. It is therefore important to "
"have as many routable nodes as possible."
