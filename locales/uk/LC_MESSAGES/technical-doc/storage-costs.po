"In Massa the ledger is shared across all nodes of the network. We need to"
" set a size limit to be able to run a node without having 100TB of "
"storage which will cause a barrier for adoption and running nodes at "
"home. We chose to limit the size to 1TB. Everyone can store data until "
"the ledger reach 1TB. But how can we ensure this limit ?"

"We chose to force users to lock coins when they claim storage space and "

"For each byte of storage you claim (for your address and balance, a key "
"in your datastore, bytecode, ...) you need to lock coins. The coins are "
"released when you release your space in the storage."

"The amount of coins you need to lock for one byte is 0.00025 Massa. This "
"value has been chosen so that if half of the coins (250 000 000 Massa) "
"are locked, we will reach the 1TB."

"As balances are stored as `varint <https://developers.google.com"
"/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints>`__ in the ledger their size can "
"vary. To avoid difficulties and incomprehension we decided to use a fixed"
" size for each balance. This size is 8 bytes and so initial ledger entry "
"(address + balance) cost (8 + 32) * 0.00025 = 0.01 Massa . Datastore keys"
" also have a variable size and so we decided to use a fixed size of 10 "
"bytes for calculating storage cost."
