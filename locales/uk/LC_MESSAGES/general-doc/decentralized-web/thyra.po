"Thyra is a secured gate to Massa blockchain and pure decentralization. "
"Developped by Massa Labs, this application provides a user-friendly way "
"of accessing, using and building on the blockchain while preventing users"
" from possible attacks or hacks. Indeed, because Thyra is installed on "
"your own device there is absolutely nothing and no one between you and "
"the blockchain. Security and decentralization are the app's pillars."

"Concretely, Thyra enables every user to have a custom experience with the"
" blockchain. Once the app is installed, users are be able to activate "
"specific functionalities in a plug-and-play mode through plugins. For "
"instance, the plugin :ref:`Node-manager <testnet-install>`. allows you to"
" run a distant node in a couple of clicks. These functionalities are, "
"technically speaking, plugins that can be developed by anyone. Technical "
"details on how to develop plugins will be added very soon."
