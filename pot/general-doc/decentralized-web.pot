msgid "It states among other things that once successfully audited, a program can remain trusted. This implies that the program of a successfully audited smart contract may never be unexpectedly changed by an outsider (note that contracts that modify their own code during runtime cannot be trusted this way in the first place, but this is visible in the code audit). Popular ETH smart contracts essentially follow that rule."

msgid "However, most DeFi web3 apps such as `app.uniswap.org <https://app.uniswap.org/>`_ are typically used through an otherwise normal website that talks to a browser plugin (typically `Metamask <https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension>`_) allowing the webpage to interact with the user's wallet and the blockchain. The website that serves as an entry point to the dApp is neither decentralized nor immutable-once-audited. This breaks the very foundation of blockchain security. And that’s how you get into situations of scandalous thefts in the DeFi world, like `this one <https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-hack-bitcoin-ethereum>`_."

msgid "The goal here is to allow addresses on Massa to store not only a balance, bytecode and a datastore, but also files, zip archive and websites without using any centralised party in between your client and the blockchain. Any address, through bytecode execution, can initialize, read and write the \"file\" part into the datastore. Files or websites, for instance, are complex objects built on top of native objects (eg: balance, bytecode...) to enable users to do more while assuring full decentralisation. The reason why we don’t simply reuse the datastore for this, outside of the risk of key collisions, is for easier auditing: if the code never writes into its own bytecode nor its datastore after deployment, it is safe to assume that the stored website can’t change anymore. Which means that Massa can host the files corresponding to the front-end of the decentralized applications. Since the front-end is hosted on the blockchain, allowing anyone to access it using a Massa node. For that Massa has developed a client that acts as a gateway to the blockchain preventing you from using any centralised servers but also maximising your security with immutable and censorship resistant websites."
