msgid "Thyra is a secured gate to Massa blockchain and pure decentralization. Developped by Massa Labs, this application provides a user-friendly way of accessing, using and building on the blockchain while preventing users from possible attacks or hacks. Indeed, because Thyra is installed on your own device there is absolutely nothing and no one between you and the blockchain. Security and decentralization are the app's pillars."

msgid "Concretely, Thyra enables every user to have a custom experience with the blockchain. Once the app is installed, users are be able to activate specific functionalities in a plug-and-play mode through plugins. For instance, the plugin :ref:`Node-manager <testnet-install>`. allows you to run a distant node in a couple of clicks. These functionalities are, technically speaking, plugins that can be developed by anyone. Technical details on how to develop plugins will be added very soon."
