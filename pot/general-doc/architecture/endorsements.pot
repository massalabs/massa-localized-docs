msgid "Massa uses the Proof-of-Stake selection mechanism with Nakamoto consensus. In that context, when there are multiple cliques in close competition, we want all nodes to converge towards a single clique as fast as possible to minimize finality time and maximize the quality of the consensus. To achieve this, we draw inspiration from Tezos and introduce the concept of Endorsement."

msgid "The likelihood of the attacker getting lucky and being selected for `N` consecutive PoS draws to attack/censor the system decays exponentially with `N`. With endorsements, we don't have to wait for `N` blocks to account for `N` proof-of-stake draws to happen as `E+1` draws happen at every slot (1 for the block creator and `E` for endorsement creators). In the consensus algorithm, we choose the clique of highest fitness as the blockclique. A block including `e` endorsements out of the maximum `E` contributes a fitness `e + 1` to the cliques it belongs to. The fitness of a block is therefore reflected by the number of PoS draws that were involved in creating it."

It then checks the endorsement producer draws for slot `S`. At every slot, there are `E` endorsement producer draws, one for each endorsement index from `0` (included) to `E-1` (included). The factory will attempt to create all the endorsements that need to be produced by keypairs its wallet manages. To choose the block to endorse, the factory asks Consensus for the ID of latest blockclique (or final) block `B` in thread `S.thread` that has a strictly lower period than `S.period`. Every created endorsement is then sent to the Endorsement Pool for future inclusion in blocks, and to Protocol for propagation to other nodes."

msgid "A finality fork attack is when an attacker that controls a portion `beta` of the total stake, decides not to broadcast the blocks he has been selected to produce, in order to construct an alternative and undisclosed clique. The attacker's goal is to produce an attack clique that has a fitness greater than the honnest clique. If he manages to do so, the attacker can wait until the finalization time of a block `b` belonging to the honest clique, to broadcast its attack clique. Because the fitness of the attack clique is greater than the honest one, a portion of the network will consider the attacker's clique to be the good version of the chain, while some other portion will have finalized block `b`. This results in a network partion, where two or more portion of the network do not agree on the state of the ledger."

#: 0be24983fcf5491b9864b2db0dae20f6
msgid "The factors that influence the success probability of a finality fork attack are the number of endorsments per block `E`, the portion of the total stake controlled by the attacker `beta` and a finality parameter `F`. The finality parameter `F` respresents a number of descendant a block must have, before being finalized. The portion of the stake `beta` is positively correlated with the success probability of an attack, while `F` and `E` are inversly correlated. We do not have control over `beta`, thus we define our security level as a portion `beta` and a maximum success probability of an attack. We chose `beta = 1/3` because it is the maximum proportion of Byzantine participants BFT based consensus protocols assume. We chose `p_success <= 1e-11` because it corresponds to a period of time of around 10 000 years (given one block every 0.5s). We must chose the minimal parameters `F` and `E` that match this security level."
