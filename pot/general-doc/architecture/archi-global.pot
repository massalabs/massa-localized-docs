msgid "This is the diagram of the architecture of the software modules involved in building, endorsing and propagating blocks. The bottom part corresponds to a single process running in a node and is in charge of the execution and consensus building. The pool and factories, referred to as \"factory\", can be potentially running in a different process or be part of the node. Overall, each of the modules described here runs inside one or more threads attached to their respective executable process (NB: the factory/node separation is not yet implemented, but will be soon)."

All the reasoning below can be in principle done on this increasingly vast set, but in practice, we will introduce a notion of \"finalized\" or \"staled\" blocks, that can be removed from the set and that will allow us to work on a smaller subset of recent blocks that are neither finalized nor staled, so \"pending\" blocks. This set of pending blocks is all the network needs to know in order to incrementally build up a consensus, therefore non-pending blocks will simply be forgotten (this is a striking difference with most other blockchains that store in each node the history of all past transactions). The main benefit of this block pruning is to allow for some of the algorithms below, which are in general NP-complete, to run fast enough on a smaller subgraph, and to allow for a practical implementation."
