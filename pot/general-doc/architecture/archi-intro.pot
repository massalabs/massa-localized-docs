msgid "The goal of the Massa network is to build a consensus between **nodes** to gather and order **blocks** that contain ordered lists of **operations**. An operation ultimate purpose once executed is to act as transitions for the global network state, called the **ledger**."

msgid "Operations are produced by external clients and sent to the Massa network via a node. Some operations are containing code to be run as **smart contracts**, enabling complex programmatic modifications of the ledger. Nodes will gather all the pending operations and group them to produce blocks. Each block contains a finite set of operations, limited by the fact that each block has a limited amount of space available to store operations. Traditional blockchains will then typically link blocks one after the other (including a hash of the previous block in the block header), to materialize their temporal ordering. However, unlike traditional blockchains, Massa blocks are not simply chained one after the other, but organized into a more complex spatio-temporal structure, which allows for parallelization and increased performances."

msgid "The time between two slots located on the same thread is called a **period** and lasts 16s (conventionally called :math:`t_0`). Corresponding slots in threads are slightly shifted in time relative to one another, by one period divided by the number of threads, which is 16s/32 = 0.5s, so that a period contains exactly 32 slots equally spaced over the 32 threads. A **cycle** is defined as the succession of 128 periods and so lasts a bit more than 34min. Periods are numbered by increments of one, so can be used together with a thread number to uniquely identify a block slot. Period 0 is the genesis and contains genesis blocks with no parents."

msgid "The job of the Massa nodes network is to essentially collectively fill up slots with valid blocks. To do so, at each interval of 0.5s, a specific node in the network is elected to be allowed to create a block (more about the selection process below, and the proof of stake sybil resistance mechanism), and will be rewarded if it creates a valid block in time. It is also possible that a node misses its opportunity to create the block, in which case the slot will remain empty (this is called a **block miss**)."

msgid "Endorsements are optional inclusion in the block, but their inclusion is incentivized for block creators. They are validations of the fact that the parent block on the thread of the block is the best parent that could have been chosen, done by other nodes that have also been deterministically selected via the proof of stake probability distribution (see below). A comprehensive description of endorsements can be found `here <https://docs.massa.net/en/latest/general-doc/architecture/endorsements.html>`_, so we will not go further into details in the context of this introduction."
