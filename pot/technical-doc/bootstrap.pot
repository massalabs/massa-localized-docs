msgid "However, new nodes joining the network need to get an absolute \"current\" version of the state, which is called \"bootstrapping\". In some blockchains like Bitcoin, full nodes joining the network are recommended to download all blocks from the beginning (genesis) of the blockchain in order to re-verify the whole state change history."

#: 31ff9d2506ad4d6796d03e4bdf3bde60
msgid "This means that the State in Massa evolves almost as fast as typical consumer desktop computers can run blocks, which implies that catching up blocks since genesis goes only slightly faster than new blocks appear in the meantime, and would take a very long time. Moreover, Massa aims at processing thousands of operations per second, which means that it produces a lot of block data every second, thus preventing nodes with the target hardware from storing the full block history and making bootstrapping from genesis impossible since old blocks are forgotten."

#: b80d74bdf6c24e6abb92f4ca77e37ce9
msgid "Note that nodes can recover from short-term disconnects by asking for missing data from nodes around them once they come back in the network. However, since Massa nodes only store a short history of blocks and forget older ones, it is impossible to recover from long disconnects since the surrounding nodes have forgotten the blocks needed by the recovering node. In that case, a new State bootstrap is required."

msgid "When Bitcoin node runners decide to join the network, they first download the node software from a central source (eg. bitcoin.org). If that source is compromised, the node might end up on a different network, and/or private key theft might happen. Bitcoin therefore requires trust in the entity sourcing the node software."

msgid "Assuming the node software is not corrupted, new nodes joining the network need an initial list of peer nodes to which they need to connect first in order to discover the network. This list is hardcoded in the node software (see `the bitcoin docs <https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/p2p_network.html#peer-discovery>`_). If all peers pointed by this initial list are compromised, the node can end on a different (non-bitcoin) network, even if the node software itself is not compromised. Bitcoin therefore also requires trust in at least one of the initial peers."

msgid "Similarly to Bitcoin checkpoints, bootstrapping Massa nodes must obtain the current State from a trusted source, ideally the same source as the one they downloaded the node software from, in order to avoid having to trust multiple entities."

msgid "Downloading the state from an untrusted source can result in major issues such as coin theft. As such, bootstrapping from untrusted sources should be discouraged, and bootstrapping other nodes should be opt-in for node runners to avoid \"bootstrap lists\" circulating as the default way of bootstrapping from unaware node runners."

msgid "In Massa, the hash of the state is used as part of the proof-of-stake seed, which is a safety mechanism against malicious bootstrap nodes sending a compromised State. It ensures that nodes with an altered State eventually end up isolated from the real network because their proof-of-stake draws differ which causes them to discard incoming honest blocks. Note however that a PoS seed mismatch can take up to 2 cycles to be detected."

msgid "By default, Massa nodes only allow a whitelist of IP addresses to bootstrap from them. This list is present in the `massa-node/base_config/bootstrap_whitelist.json` file. This list is intended to prevent flooding attacks by attackers pretending to be bootstrapping, and also makes it more difficult for node runners to bootstrap from untrusted sources. If you wish to disable whitelisting and allow anyone to bootstrap from your node, simply delete the `bootstrap_whitelist.json` file and restart your node."

msgid "Once a node has accepted to bootstrap an incoming node, it adds the incoming node's IP address to a local cache preventing that IP from bootstrapping again for a time defined in `massa-node/base_config/config.toml` (section `bootstrap/per_ip_min_interval`) by refusing subsequent connections from that IP during the config-defined delay. The exclusion delay is not extended if the remote IP attempts new connections during the exclusion delay. The exclusion delay is however applied if the bootstrap was accepted but failed for any reason. This aims at limiting the load on individual bootstrap nodes, and spreading the load among bootstrap nodes."
