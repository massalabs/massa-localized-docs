msgid "The philosophy of Massa is to be as decentralized as possible. To fulfill this goal, we aim to have low hardware requirements so that many people can run nodes. Right now 4 cores and 8 GB of RAM should be enough to run a node. As the transaction rate increases, it might not be sufficient anymore. Ultimately, we plan that the mainnet fits on a desktop computer with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 1TB disk."
