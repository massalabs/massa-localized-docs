Try stopping the node, overwriting staking_keys.json with your backup, and starting the node again to try again. You can also manually add a staking key by calling ``add_staking_keys`` with the KEY matching the address that has active rolls in ``wallet_info`` (warning: do not type the address or public key, only the SECRET KEY)."
