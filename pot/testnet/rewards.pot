msgid "Staking is what improves the security of the network. By buying rolls (freezing your coins) and producing your share of the blocks, you help honest nodes collectively protect against potential attackers, who must not reach 51% of the block production. On mainnet, staking is incentivized through block rewards: for each block produced, you get some Massa. On testnet however, you get testnet Massa which has no value, this is why we will reward you with mainnet Massa for learning to set up your node and stake right now, which also helps us improve the staking user experience."

msgid "On July 16th we launched the first public version of Massa, the first testnet. More than 350 nodes were connected at the same time after one week, which overloaded our bootstrap nodes which were the only nodes accepting connections. By setting your node up to be routable (with a public IP), you become a real peer in the peer-to-peer network: you not only connect to existing routable nodes, but you offer other people the possibility to access the network through your connection. We will therefore also reward how often your node is publicly accessible."
